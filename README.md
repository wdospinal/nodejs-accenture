## Workflow and code style guide
We use [airbnb-javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as JavaScript style guide.

**Guidelines:**

* If your code will perform asynchronous operations it must use promises
* Every bug should be registered as an issue
* Your code should be almost entirely written in english
* Your code should follow the [airbnb-javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) style guide
* Your commits should be written in english, they must be descriptive and minimalist
* You should try to use testing in your code, but this is not required

**Note:** _Your code could be rejected by breaking the above rules._
